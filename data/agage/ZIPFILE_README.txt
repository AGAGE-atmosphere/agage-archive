# This is a zip folder containing combined AGAGE/ALE/GAGE archive data. 
# The ALE/GAGE files were created by Derek Cunnold and his team at Georgia Tech (GA Tech.) in the early 1990s. These data were all converted from earlier scales 
# to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) 1993 scale (SIO-93; see Cunnold et al., 1994 and Prinn et al., 2000).
# The AGAGE data come from the output netCDF files from GCWerks, and this combined dataset was generated by Matt Rigby at the University of Bristol.
# For questions, please contact matt.rigby@bristol.ac.uk
#
# This folder is organised by species. Within the species directory, if multiple instruments have measured the species at a single site, there is a 'combined' .nc file. 
# The individual data files for each instrument can be found in the sub-directory 'individual'. 
# Otherwise, the files are labelled as NETWORK-INSTRUMENT_SITE_species.nc
# 
# For example, the cfc-11 folder contains:
#
# AGAGE-combined_CGO_cfc11.nc
# AGAGE-combined_CMO_cfc11.nc
# AGAGE-combined_MHD_cfc11.nc
# AGAGE-combined_RPB_cfc11.nc
# AGAGE-combined_SMO_cfc11.nc

# AGAGE Data Statement:
#
# These data are made available to the scientific community in the belief that their wide use will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights. 
# The availability of these data does not constitute publication of the data. AGAGE relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to insure that the AGAGE 
# scientists receive fair credit for their work. If the data are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, AGAGE should be informed at the 
# outset of the nature of this work. If the AGAGE  data are essential to the work, or if an important result or conclusion depends on the AGAGE data, 
# co-authorship may be appropriate. This should be discussed at an early stage in the work with the General AGAGE contacts listed below. Manuscripts using the 
# AGAGE data should be sent to the AGAGE contacts for review before they are submitted for publication so we can insure that the quality and limitations of 
# the data are accurately represented. Every effort is made to produce the most accurate and precise measurements possible. However, we reserve the right to make 
# corrections to the data based on recalibration of standard gases or for other reasons deemed scientifically justified. We are not responsible for results and 
# conclusions based on use of these data without regard to this warning.
#
# AGAGE Data Reciprocity Agreement
#
# Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate. Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their own data available to the general public 
# and to the scientific community in an equally complete and easily accessible form. Scientists  are encouraged to make available to the community, upon request, 
# their own modelling tools used in the interpretation of the AGAGE data, namely well documented model code, transport fields, and additional information necessary 
# for other scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
