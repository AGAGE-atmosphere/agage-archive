# File specifying when to use the various ALE/GAGE/AGAGE instruments
# A blank entry in either the start or end date means that the time is unbounded at that side
# If there is no entry for a species it is assumed that it is only measured on the GCMS-Medusa
# Time periods can overlap if you want to keep both instruments
# An x indicates that this instrument should not be included in timeseries for this species
# Date format should be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
# NOTE: ENSURE CELLS ARE FORMATTED AS TEXT, NOT DATES. IF PASTING VALUES ENSURE YOU "MATCH DESTINATION FORMATTING" TO PREVENT EXCEL FROM CONVERTING TO DATE AND TIME
