#  AGAGE Data README file
This archive contains the complete AGAGE/ALE/GAGE dataset. 

The archive is compiled from early ALE/GAGE files combined with AGAGE files output from the GCWerks software. The code for processing and standardising these data is at https://github.com/mrghg/agage-archive. The ALE/GAGE files were created by Derek Cunnold's team at Georgia Tech (GA Tech.) in the early 1990s, and are archived at https://github.com/mrghg/agage-archive/tree/main/data/agage/ale_gage_sio1993. These data were themselves converted from earlier scales to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) 1993 scale (SIO-93; see Cunnold et al., 1994 and Prinn et al., 2000). The GA Tech. files are reprocessed here and converted to more recent scales. See the Methodology notes in the agage-archive repository for details.

The AGAGE data come from netCDF files generated by GCWerks, with some minor modifications using the agage-archive code.

The code for reprocessing the AGAGE data is currently maintained by the University of Bristol. Contact matt.rigby@bristol.ac.uk with errors and questions. For questions regarding individual data sources, please contact the relevant AGAGE station PIs (contact details are contained in file metadata).

# Format and Structure

This archive consists of a set of netCDF files. For information on the netCDF file format see: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/

Filenames follow the convention:

```network{-instrument}_sitecode_species_{filetype-}version.nc```

Where the elements in curly brackets are optional, depending on the file.

At the first level, the archive is organised by species. The files in this top-level directory are the "default" ALE/GAGE/AGAGE high-frequency records that should be sufficient for most users. Here, high-frequency can refer to the instantaneous or integrated observations on gas chromatography systems, and/or hourly averages from optical instruments. These files may be a combination of multiple instruments for some species. 

There are sub-directories within each species directory. The ```monthly-baseline``` directory contains monthly mean mole fractions calculated using the AGAGE statistical pollution algorithm (see O'Doherty et al., 2001). The individual flags are contained in the ```baseline-flag``` folder. 

The ```individual-instrument``` sub-directory contains files for every ALE/GAGE/AGAGE instrument, several of which have been combined to for the default files.

# AGAGE Data Statement:

These data are made available to the scientific community in the belief that their wide use will lead to new scientific insights. The availability of these data does not constitute publication of the data. AGAGE relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to ensure that the AGAGE scientists receive fair credit for their work. If the data are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation, AGAGE should be informed at the outset of this work. If the AGAGE  data are essential to the work, or if an important result or conclusion depends on the AGAGE data, co-authorship may be appropriate. This should be discussed at an early stage with the AGAGE contacts listed below. Manuscripts using the AGAGE data should be sent to the AGAGE contacts for review before they are submitted for publication so we can ensure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately represented. Every effort is made to produce the most accurate and precise measurements possible. However, we reserve the right to make corrections to the data based on recalibration of standard gases or for other reasons deemed scientifically justified. We are not responsible for results and conclusions based on use of these data without regard to this warning.

# AGAGE Data Reciprocity Agreement

Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate. Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their own data available to the general public and to the scientific community in an equally complete and easily accessible form. Scientists  are encouraged to make available to the community, upon request, their own modelling tools used in the interpretation of the AGAGE data, namely well documented model code, transport fields, and additional information necessary for other scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
