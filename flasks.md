# Processing flask data

Flask data output by GCCompare can be processed using the ```read_gcwerks_flask``` function. 

There must be site specific attributes file for these datasets (```network/attributes_site.json```), because of the lack of metadata in the files.

Flask networks should be processed from project-specific repositories, **not** added to this repo.
